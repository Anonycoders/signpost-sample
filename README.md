# Signpost

**A static site that answers "what is the platform team doing, and what is about to change?"** — built from Markdown files in a Git repository, deployed to GitHub Pages, with no database and no server.

## This repository is the live sample

The product lives at **[Anonycoders/signpost](https://github.com/Anonycoders/signpost)** and ships empty, ready to adopt. This repository is a copy of it with the demo content left in, kept running so that anyone deciding whether to adopt Signpost can read a populated site instead of an empty one.

Everything under `content/` here is fictional — four invented platform teams, thirteen streamlines — and `Example Organization` is not a real company. Nothing here is a statement about anybody's roadmap.

**If you want to run Signpost, start at the template, not here.** Forking this repository means inheriting a demo you will have to delete.

### Keeping this in step with the template

The product's own history is upstream, so improvements are merged in rather than reimplemented:

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/Anonycoders/signpost.git
git fetch template
git merge template/main
```

**The first such merge will delete `content/`, and that is expected.** The template removes the demo content from itself in order to ship empty; merging that commit applies the deletion here, where the demo is the entire point. Put it back once, in the same sitting:

```bash
git checkout ORIG_HEAD -- content/    # ORIG_HEAD is the pre-merge tip, set by git merge
git commit -m "Restore the sample content after syncing with the template"
```

Only that one merge needs it. Afterwards `content/` exists on this side of the history and not upstream, so every later `git merge template/main` leaves it alone — no conflict, no restore step, nothing to remember.

---

Platform teams ship things that land on everyone else: a cluster upgrade, a CI migration, a deprecated gateway. The work is usually visible *somewhere* — a wiki page, a Slack thread, a Jira epic nobody outside the team can read — and the result is the same either way. Other teams find out when something breaks.

Signpost gives every team one file per effort. They edit it when the plan changes, open a pull request, and the site rebuilds. Anyone can see which stage each effort is in, when it lands, and who owns it — and subscribe to a feed so they do not have to check.

## What it looks like

**[See it running →](https://anonycoders.github.io/signpost-sample/)** — a populated instance with four invented platform teams and thirteen streamlines, published from [`Anonycoders/signpost-sample`](https://github.com/Anonycoders/signpost-sample). This repository is the template that sample was made from, and it ships empty; the screenshots below are of the sample.

**Roadmap** — every effort as a lane across six quarters, filterable by team, stage and category.

| Light | Dark |
| --- | --- |
| ![The roadmap page in the light theme](docs/screenshots/roadmap-light.png) | ![The roadmap page in the dark theme](docs/screenshots/roadmap-dark.png) |

**Changes** — a reverse-chronological log of what teams have announced, with breaking changes marked and dated.

**Home** — what landed recently and what lands soon, above everything else.

Plus a filterable catalog of every streamline, a page per team, a page per streamline with its full timeline and update history, and an `/about/` page explaining the whole thing to a first-time visitor.

**[docs/using.md](docs/using.md)** is the guide for the people who only ever read the site: what a hatched bar with a diamond on it means, which window the attention strip covers, and how to point a feed reader or a Slack channel at one team's work.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anonycoders/signpost-sample.git
cd signpost-sample
nvm use          # Node 26, per .nvmrc — the repo sets engine-strict
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4321
```

`content/` ships empty, so that is an empty site — every page renders, and every page tells you what to add. Filling it is [docs/adopting.md](docs/adopting.md); the [sample](https://anonycoders.github.io/signpost-sample/) is where it ends up.

Other scripts:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run validate` | Content validator — the same one CI runs |
| `npm run check` | TypeScript and Astro diagnostics |
| `npm run test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run build` | Validate, then build the static site into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve `dist/` as it will be deployed |

If `npm install` refuses to run, it is `engine-strict` doing its job: this needs Node 22.12 or newer, and `.nvmrc` pins the version the project is built against.

## Publishing your team's work

One Markdown file per streamline, in `content/streamlines/<team>/<slug>.md`. Frontmatter holds the structured part — stage, owners, timeline dates, links — and `updates:` is the running log of announcements, newest first:

```yaml
updates:
  - date: 2026-09-10       # when you posted it
    status: rolling-out
    effective: 2026-10-01  # when it actually lands on people
    impact: breaking
    title: Production clusters upgrade from 1 October — Ingress v1beta1 is removed
    body: |
      Production upgrades run in three waves starting **1 October**. Any workload
      still declaring `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` Ingress objects will fail to
      deploy once its cluster is upgraded.
```

Edit, open a pull request, CODEOWNERS routes it to your team, CI validates it, merge deploys it. The validator blocks the mistakes that make a roadmap untrustworthy — a deprecation with no retirement date, a breaking change with no notice period, a timeline that runs backwards — and it explains what to fix rather than which schema rule failed.

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** is the five-minute version: templates to copy, every field explained, and what CI will and will not let through.

---

## Running it for your own organization

Fork it, edit one config file, add your content. **[docs/adopting.md](docs/adopting.md)** walks through it: naming and branding, defining your own lifecycle stages and categories, wiring CODEOWNERS to your teams, deploying to GitHub Pages (including GitHub Enterprise), and what to do if your instance has Pages turned off.

Everything an organization needs to change lives in [`site.config.ts`](site.config.ts) — the stages, the categories, the impact levels, the colours, the attention windows. The rules follow the config: rename `deprecated` to `sunsetting` and the validator's messages, the filters and the roadmap legend all rename with it.

---

## How it works

**Git is the database.** There is no CMS, no admin login, no runtime. `content/` is the source of truth; the site is a pure function of it. Reviewing a roadmap change is reviewing a diff, and the history of what a team promised is `git log`.

**The build is the gatekeeper.** `scripts/content-rules.ts` holds the rules, shared between the CLI validator and the Astro build via one set of Zod schemas, so CI and your editor cannot disagree. Errors block the merge; softer things (a streamline nobody has updated in a long time) warn.

**Feeds, so nobody has to remember to look.** A site-wide Atom feed at `/feed.xml` and one per team, hand-built to Atom 1.0 (RFC 4287) with stable entry IDs — so a feed reader, a Slack integration or a Teams connector can subscribe once and get every announcement.

**A nightly rebuild.** "Landing in 60 days" is only true on the day it is built, so the deploy workflow also runs on a schedule. The rationale is in [docs/adopting.md](docs/adopting.md#5-deploy-to-pages).

**It prints.** The roadmap and the changes log have print stylesheets, for the people who bring a roadmap to a planning meeting on paper. One known limitation: a roadmap that spans more than one printed page does not repeat the quarter headers on the second page.

### Layout

```
content/
  teams/<slug>.yaml            one file per team
  streamlines/<team>/<slug>.md one file per effort
site.config.ts                 everything an organization changes
src/
  pages/                       routes
  lib/                         roadmap, changes, timeline, feeds — unit-tested
  components/                  Astro components
scripts/
  content-rules.ts             the validation rules
  validate-content.ts          the CLI wrapper CI runs
.github/
  workflows/ci.yml             validate + check + test on every PR
  workflows/deploy.yml         build + publish to Pages on main and nightly
  CODEOWNERS                   which team reviews which directory
```

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). No client-side framework: the filters are under a hundred lines of vanilla JavaScript over server-rendered cards, and every page still renders its content without them.
