    title: First 40 datasets are indexed
    body: |
      Warehouse tables first; event streams and object storage follow. Personal
      data classification is being reviewed with Legal before anything is opened
      up more widely.

## What this is

An index over the warehouse, event streams and shared object storage, with
ownership, freshness and sensitivity classification attached to each dataset.

## Who this affects

Anyone who has asked "is there already a table for this?" and could not find
out. Nothing is required of dataset owners yet; when rollout begins in December
we will ask for classification on datasets we cannot infer.
