## What this is

A registry of every service, its owning team, its dependencies and its on-call
route. Populated from repository metadata, so it stays current without anyone
maintaining it by hand.

## Who this affects

Everyone, occasionally — usually at the worst moment, when something is broken
and you need to find its owner.
