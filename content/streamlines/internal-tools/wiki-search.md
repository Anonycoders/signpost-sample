## Why this was retired

Two search boxes that returned different results for the same query, neither of
which covered everything. The service catalog now indexes the wiki alongside
service metadata, so one search covers both.

## Kept here on purpose

Retired streamlines stay on this site rather than being deleted, so that anyone
following an old link or wondering what happened to a tool can find the answer.
